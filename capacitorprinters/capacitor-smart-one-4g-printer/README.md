# @zpos/capacitor-smart-one-4g-printer

Capacitor plugin scaffold for the Smart One 4G printer, to be migrated from the `smart-one-4g-printer` Cordova project.

This package defines a minimal TypeScript API and Capacitor registration. The native Android implementation should be ported from the existing Cordova sources.
